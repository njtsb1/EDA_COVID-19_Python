# Predicting the Evolution of COVID-19 in Brazil

## Creating Models with Python and Machine Learning

Project developed at the Bootcamp Geração Tech Unimed-BH - Data Science with guidance from specialist [Neylson Crepalde](github.com/neylsoncrepalde/ "Neylson Crepalde").

Learning to investigate data on the spread of COVID-19 in Brazil since the beginning of the pandemic in February 2020. Study the patterns of spread of the disease, investigate the numbers of infected, recovered and deaths, to build models with Python and Machine Learning to predict the numbers in the coming days and the turning point of the infection curve based on some scenarios.
